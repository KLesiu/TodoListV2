<h1 align="center" id="title">ToDoList v2</h1>

<p id="description">Hi. After a week of working on this project I am very happy to publish it. This project is somewhat unique in that it had a time limit unlike my previous projects. I undertook to create it in a week learning the very basics of Angular and NestJs which I had never dealt with before. During the entire preparatory and creative period I acquired a lot of knowledge which I am really proud of because I even had to stay up all night several times just to complete this project in the best possible way. As for my feelings about the Angular&amp;NestJS duo they are very positive. What's more I think I had a much better experience writing in it than in the ReactJs&amp;ExpressJs duo so I am willing to introduce this duo as a basic one in my next projects and explore even more possibilities.</p>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   User registration and login
*   Saving user sessions via JWT in local storage
*   Adding new tasks
*   Deleting selected task
*   Changing the 'done' status of task (after single-click on it)
*   Updating selected task (after double-click on it)

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone repo</p>

```
git clone git@github.com:KLesiu/TodoListV2.git

```
cd TodoListV2
```

<p>3. Build app from docker</p>

```
docker compose build
```

<p>4. Start app from docker</p>
